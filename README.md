# Atmega328p_Labb02

Working with the timer-functions on Arduino Uno with external shield that's got an RGB-led soldered on the surface along with matching resistors.
Also a common led is attached to digital pin 6 of the board, along with a 220 ohm resistor as the soldered RGB-led is on digital register B and not D.

Lots of trail and error but a great exercise to learn how to bitshift and accesses the different registers of the atmega328p.
